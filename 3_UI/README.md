# 🧠 3_UI: Knowledge & Skill Acquisition

- **Premise:** Development is a journey of learning.
- **Content:** A personal knowledge base for concepts, theories, and skills.
- **Conclusion:** Fosters continuous improvement.

## 🎨 The User Interface
In this project, the **UI is the Notebook itself**, demonstrating the sanitization pipeline visually.

### Attack Demonstration Section
-   **Markdown Cells**: Explain adversarial attack methods.
-   **Code Cells**: Generate FGSM/PGD adversarial examples.
-   **Visualizations**: Show original vs adversarial images.

### Sanitization Techniques Section
-   **Markdown Cells**: Explain each defense technique's mechanism.
-   **Code Cells**: Implement feature squeezing, JPEG compression, Gaussian filtering.
-   **Visualizations**: Display sanitized images and their effect on perturbations.

### Defense Evaluation Section
-   **Markdown Cells**: Explain effectiveness metrics.
-   **Code Cells**: Test model on sanitized adversarial examples.
-   **Visualizations**: Compare accuracy before/after sanitization.

### Quality Analysis Section
-   **Markdown Cells**: Discuss quality-security tradeoff.
-   **Code Cells**: Measure PSNR, SSIM on clean images.
-   **Visualizations**: Show quality degradation on legitimate inputs.

### Interactive Elements
-   Side-by-side image comparisons (original, adversarial, sanitized)
-   Defense effectiveness bar charts
-   Quality metrics vs defense strength tradeoff curves
